Creating my first P5 sketch was diving into a new way of coding which I found quite challenging. At first, understanding the structure of P5.js—how setup() runs once and draw() loops continuously was confusing, and I often put code in the wrong place or didn’t expect certain behaviors.
Tracking down small errors, like missing semicolons or wrong variable usage, was tricky and time-consuming.
